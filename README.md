# auto-ambience
Auto-Ambience is a simple Python 3.4 application which takes a block of text (sentence or paragraph) and creates an ambient soundscape via http://myNoise.net. Note: This is a command-line application intended for patrons of MyNoise. I will eventually translate this into a web application.
