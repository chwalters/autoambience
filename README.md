# auto-ambience
Auto-Ambience is a simple Python 3.4 application which takes a block of text (sentence or paragraph) and creates an ambient soundscape via http://myNoise.net. Note: This is a command-line application intended for patrons of MyNoise. I will eventually translate this into a web application.

## Setting up AutoAmbience
First, ensure you have numpy installed. This is a requirement for tensorflow, which does a great deal of the heavy lifting.

When you have numpy installed, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
